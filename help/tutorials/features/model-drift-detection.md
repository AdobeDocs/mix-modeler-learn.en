# Model drift detection

With Mix Modeler's model drift detection feature, changes in model performance are automatically detected and users are notified. They can take immediate action to return the model to optimal performance. For more information, see [Model drift](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/mix-modeler/using/models/insights#model-drift){target="_blank"} in the Mix Modeler documentation.
